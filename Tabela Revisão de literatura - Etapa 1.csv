A correct and complete implementation starting from the requirements definition allows to significantly increase the security level of each single phase/iteration and consequently of the final system. Therefore, it is necessary to support the team throughout the software lifecycle trying to provide operational guidelines of security by design and privacy by design. Taking these aspects into account, the paper presents a Human Centered Design (HCD) approach of security and privacy-oriented software development, integrated within the Scrum agile methodology, defined as HCD-Security Scrum. The goal is to support developer decisions at all stages of software development in integrating security and privacy requirements through the formalization of key elements defined in a knowledge base, i.e., the Privacy Knowledge Base.",,X,X,X,,,,,Aceito

As matter of fact, the software is prone to vulnerabilities and cybersecurity problems, which are challenging to manage during the software lifecycle. The situation is further compounded by the growing demand for rapid application development and the widespread diffusion of Agile methodologies and the DevOps culture. This process promotes collaboration within and between the different groups involved in software development. In recent years there has been a spread of new or adapted security-oriented methodologies providing different approaches to identify security problems in the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), thus reducing the costs for the security assessment. SecDevOps is just an example of the integration and promotion of security aspects in DevOps organizations. While these methodologies help to produce more reliable software, on other hand they are difficult to integrate into standard or customized SDLC, or with design evaluation and risk management methodologies. This work analyzes the state of the art and aims at identifying the main activities in a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), by proposing a new secure software development lifecycle meta-model (MetaSEnD). MetaSEnD has also been applied in a continuous integration pipeline of a sample microservices application.",,X,X,X,,,,,Aceito

In addition to business objectives, software development also has security objectives requiring security engineering activities. In contrast to the iterative and incremental software development process, software security engineering is defined by sequential life cycle models: security and business objectives are thus implemented using conflicting approaches. To identify the incompatibilities between the methodologies, in this study the security engineering activities are mapped into common agile software development practises, processes and artifacts. Security engineering activities from Microsoft SDL, the ISO Common Criteria and OWASP SAMM security development lifecycle models are mapped into common agile processes, practises and artifacts. The organizational and technical aspects of the mapping are considered primarily from the point of view of achieving the security objectives set for the software engineering process: setting security requirements for design, their implementation and verification, and releasing secure software through efficient software security development process.",,X,X,X,,,,,Aceito

First, IoT applications require both software and hardware to work together across many different types of nodes with different capabilities under different conditions. Second, IoT application development involves different types of software engineers such as desktop, web, embedded, and mobile to work together. Furthermore, non-software engineering personnel such as business analysts are also involved in the design process. In addition to the complexity of having multiple software engineering specialists cooperating to merge different hardware and software components together, the development process requires different software and hardware stacks to be integrated together (e.g., different stacks from different companies such as Microsoft Azure and IBM Bluemix). Due to the above complexities, non-functional requirements (such as security and privacy, which are highly important in the context of the IoT) tend to be ignored or treated as though they are less important in the IoT application development process. This article reviews techniques, methods, and tools to support security and privacy requirements in existing non-IoT application designs, enabling their use and integration into IoT applications. This article primarily focuses on design notations, models, and languages that facilitate capturing non-functional requirements (i.e., security and privacy). Our goal is not only to analyse, compare, and consolidate the empirical research but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability for the IoT.",,,,,,X,,,Rejeitado

Since security threat assessment is performed on a conceptualised model of the system under analysis, human expertise is relied upon to exhaustively elicit all possible threats. To this end, the outcomes of threat analysis depend on the individual actors involved in the process. However, human expertise can be biased depending on certain or a combination of human factors. [Goal:] With this work, we aim to unveil the effect (if any) of human factors (e.g., gender, age, seniority, educational background, nationality) to security risk assessment. [Method:] To contribute to this body of knowledge, we are conducting a state-of-the-art literature review and several experiments with human participants (experts and non-experts) in the domain of security and risk assessment.

In an attempt to minimize these problems, the Privacy by Design approach has been proposed to ensure that privacy requirements are incorporated from the early stages of system development and applied to the entire data lifecycles. Meanwhile, Privacy by Design is often criticized due to its lack of specific methodology and tools capable of translating its principles into practical Software Engineering activities. Therefore, this research aims to investigate, through a systematic literature review, how Privacy by Design principles have been applied in the Software Engineering area. The search retrieved 6046 primary articles, published up to May 2022. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 75 primary studies were selected for analysis.

DevOps practices like canary releasing and A/B testing aim to improve the quality of the software that is built by CD pipelines while keeping a high pace of development.

The three most notable that have witnessed significant advancements and have a solid track record of exponential growth in diverse applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Mobile Computing. The ubiquity of these paradigms, their expandability, and applicability in different problem spaces have made them invaluable in modern computing solutions. Security becomes a real concern, especially when it comes to the development of applications in these environments, as numerous security issues may arise from potential design flaws. Secure application development across these three technologies can only be achieved when applications and systems are designed and developed with security in mind. This will improve the quality of the solutions and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified. It will also help in defining countermeasures against cyberattacks or mitigate the effects of potential threats to the systems.

Software developers are not aware of security engineering practices, or find them external to the software development process. To the management, security work presents itself in the form of reactive testing performed out of necessity, incurring only costs in terms of time and resources. The long-term benefits of the security work are more difficult to demonstrate and the security investment harder to justify.
Objectives: The concept of technical debt is widely used, but its benefits for software security improvement and security risk management have not been fully realized. To make the direct and indirect benefits of security work in software development more visible and therefore more justifiable, the security risk in software is expressed in the terms of technical debt. Correspondingly, the security engineering techniques are utilized to recognize a technical debt containing a security risk: security debt.
Method: The concept of managing security risk as technical debt in software development is constructed. It is then analysed using an evaluation framework drawn from literature.
Result: Four central types of technical debt are considered for sources of security debt: requirements, architecture, code, and testing. Each type of security technical debt is analyzed from the aspect of three activities: identification, measurability and management, and repayment. The technical and organizational effects of applying this concept are examined. The evaluation framework increases the ability to identify technical debt through security practices, and to effectively mitigate security risk using technical debt management practices and tools. The framework deals with security issues in software architecture, code, and testing (ACT-S).
Conclusion: Security engineering techniques provide an effective method to recognize internal quality issues in software requirements, architecture, coding, and testing. When expressed as technical debt, the management of security risk and addressing the underlying quality issues can gain increased visibility and can be more communicated between developers, security experts, and the management.",,,,,X,,,,Rejeitado

A validated self-efficacy scale is used as a proxy for measuring effects on participants' ability to develop secure software. We tested this design with 9 participants (expert and novice developers and security experts) as part of a small feasibility study to understand the challenges and limitations of remote tabletop games. We describe how we selected and digitalised three security tabletop games, and report the qualitative findings from our evaluation. Setting up and running the virtual tabletop games turned out to be more challenging and complex for both moderator and participants than we expected. Completing the games required patience and persistence, and social interaction was limited.

These differing models have moved software development groups from sequential development to a more agile and iterative development model. Increasing awareness and research focused on the cyber security landscape has resulted in a large push for ""shifting security left"" in the SDLC. With security engineering teams engaged earlier and more often throughout the SDLC, security issues will be found and fixed earlier, which increases efficiency while lowering cost and overhead. While this has been an important cultural and infrastructural shift for many technology companies, there is still a gap in this feedback loop that needs to be bridged: the gap between user experience designers and the software, security, and IT/operations engineers. Trade-offs have been made between security and usability---a challenge known as ""usability versus security."" Much of the research that propose how to change these two fields from opposing forces to being cross-functional allies offer simplified solutions but don't go into granular detail about solving the problem. This paper covers the evolution of the SDLC from the Waterfall model through the DevSecOps agile methodology and proposes a new development model: the Technology Development Lifecycle (TDLC). This TDLC model aims to keep designers, software engineers, security engineers, and IT/operations all within a tight feedback loop throughout a continuous integration/continuous development pipeline.

Investigating Software Developers’ Intention to Follow Privacy Engineering Methodologies,"With the increasing concerns over privacy in software systems, there is a growing enthusiasm to develop methods to support the development of privacy aware software systems. Inadequate privacy in software system designs could result in users losing their sensitive data, such as health information and financial information, which may cause financial and reputation loss. Privacy Engineering Methodologies (PEMs) are introduced into the software development processes with the goal of guiding software developers to embed privacy into the systems they design. However, for PEMs to be successful it is imperative that software developers have a positive intention to use PEMs. Otherwise, developers may attempt to bypass the privacy methodologies or use them partially and hence develop software systems that may not protect user privacy appropriately. To investigate the factors that affect software developers’ behavioural intention to follow PEMs, in this article, we conducted a study with 149 software developers. Findings of the study show that the usefulness of the PEM to the developers’ existing work to be the strongest determinant that affects software developers’ intention to follow PEMs. Moreover, the compatibility of the PEM with their way of work and how the PEM demonstrates its results when used were also found to be significant. These findings provide important insights in understanding the behaviour of software developers and how they perceive PEMs. The findings could be used to assist organisations and researchers to deploy PEMs and design PEMs that are positively accepted by software developers.",,,,,,X,X,,Rejeitado

Arguing that each of the security properties for a given system is satisfied and supported by evidence is a requirement for presenting an effective and compelling security assurance argument. The decomposition of a security assurance case to support this argumentation can be challenging as different systems have different security objectives and, consequently, different security requirements. In this paper, we propose a security assurance argument pattern called Security Property Decomposition. This pattern is extracted by studying existing security assurance case models and their decomposition to argue the satisfaction of security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It also considers the requirements prescribed by several prominent security standards for developing secure and trustworthy systems in different application domains. As a result, the Security Property Decomposition pattern can be instantiated in the context of different application domains to demonstrate that the security requirements related to the functionality of the system have been adequately satisfied as part of a structured security assurance case. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed pattern, we present an application of the pattern demonstrating compliance with a relevant security standard in the automotive domain.",,,,,,X,X,,Rejeitado

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are the main input for threat modeling techniques such as Microsoft STRIDE or LINDDUN. They represent system-level abstractions that lack any architectural knowledge on existing security solutions.

However, this is not how software is built in practice: there are often previously-made security- and privacy-relevant decisions that originate from the technological context or domain, reuse, or external dependencies. Not taking these into account leads to the enumeration of many non-applicable threats during threat modeling. While recording the effect of these decisions on individual elements can provide some relief, the lack of a proper first-class representation causes conflicts when modifying the architecture and inhibits traceability between effect and decision.

In this paper, we enrich Data Flow Diagrams with security solution elements, which are taken into account during threat elicitation.

The prerequisites for key changes can be summarized as follows: cyber threats are evolving; there are leaks of special services tools; agile development methodology is being introduced everywhere; the boundaries of the object of protection are blurred; the scope of application of artificial intelligence is expanding; potentially vulnerable API integrations are increasingly being used. These factors lead to the fact that the processes of analysis of cyber threats, analysis of protective measures, generalization of data, and development of protective tools should now be considered continuous, not discrete. At the same time, the cost of cybersecurity increases like an avalanche in an attempt to avoid reputational and information losses. The only way to avoid this tendency is to apply a rational, scientific, accurate method of cognition to these processes. Thus, the creation of mathematical models of processes in the field of cybersecurity is now more relevant than ever. The article is devoted to the investigation of the process of the influence of an active viral cyber threat on a high-availability cluster in the paradigm of the provisions of the theory of Markov processes, graph theory and the theory of mathematical analysis. The main contribution of the research is a formalized computationally efficient method of approximate estimation of the average number of affected elements of the target high-availability cluster under the influence of an active viral cyber threat. Also, a criterion that allows estimating the trend of the quantitative parameter of the metric of the model of the studied process at medium and long time intervals is proposed. To obtain the declared scientific result, the authors: - formulated a Markov model of the process of the influence of an active viral cyber threat on a high availability cluster; - substantiated a compact metric for accurate assessment of the average number of cluster elements affected by an active viral cyber threat at any time; - formulated a computationally efficient method of approximate estimation of the parameter of the mentioned metric for the model of the target studied process; - proposed a criterion that allows researchers to evaluate the trend of the parameter of the mentioned metric for the model of the target researched process at medium and long intervals of time.

Prescriptive software security approaches do not match well with agile software development and its emphasis on self-management. Agile approaches are however in favour of meetings as a coordination and problem-solving strategy. This article investigates the role of regular security meetings centred on making security priorities and decisions for achieving continuous software security. Through technical action research and an observational case study, we studied variations of such meetings in three companies. We found that such meetings can reach key stakeholders, make security more visible, and contribute to ongoing security prioritisation. Thus, security meetings are a promising approach, especially for small and medium sized development companies with basic yet immature security competence. Future research should investigate further the role of such meetings and how best to organise them for different contexts and needs. For this we outline implications for research and practice, e.g., related to participants and how to organise the discussions and prioritisations in the meeting.",,X,X,X,,,,,Aceito

We take this problem towards an integrated approach for threat detection and treatment by means of security requirements, during the software architecture design time. The general idea of the approach is to: (1) specify threats as properties of a modeled system in a technology-independent specification language; (2) express conditions that reveal these threats in a suitable language with automated tool support for threat detection through model verification; and (3) suggest a set of security requirements to protect against detected threats. The formalized threats and security requirements are then provided as formal model libraries to foster reuse.

Open-source software (OSS) and cloud technologies are taking up business innovation and DevOps at new heights. However, in the quest of agility and velocity, user data security and privacy assurance often get lower priority as they are perceived as a time-consuming activity requiring specialized people, process, and technology. We see this problem being addressed by integrating security in DevOps processes. Security for DevOps has been institutionalized as DevSecOps with practical considerations for a given business context. In this work, we proposed a conceptual security model, ADOC, to facilitate adopting DevSecOps for the business processes capitalizing OSS over the cloud. This work contributes towards the following to integrate continuous security in application and service delivery: (i) A continuous security conceptual framework proposal based on the requirements elicited from the analysis of challenges in adopting DevSecOps using OSS over the cloud. (ii) An integrationist security model, ADOC, based on the proposed continuous security conceptual framework, integrating development, security, and operation activities through automation of security controls using OSS over the cloud. (iii) A set of inter-working OSS tools for automation of the proposed security controls in ADOC workflow and practices. (iv) A set of metrics for performance measurement of the ADOC model. (v) Mapping of the solutions for the analyzed challenges using the proposed security controls, followed by a use case scenario to adopt the ADOC workflow and continuous practices. The ADOC transforms security being adhoc compliance-oriented activities into continuous assurance-oriented activities by codifying security controls into an automated delivery workflow.

Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks have brought critical interruptions in IoT services and significantly damage the network. In DDoS attacks, attackers utilize botnets, with the capability of frequently exploiting the millions of IoT devices around the globe. After the source code of Mirai malware is loaded on GitHub, the threats are significantly increased. Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is an embedded software standard for IoT device makers to advertise device specifications, including the intended communication patterns when it connects to the network. Even though the MUD mechanism is promising exertion, still there is a need for evaluating its viability, recognize its limits, and upgrade its architecture to reduce shortcomings in its architecture as well as to increase its effectiveness. This standard neither identifies the vulnerability path before the creation of the MUD profile. Thus, it is possible to exploit an IoT device even after the MUD profile is issued to the device by manipulating the vulnerabilities in the device. By keeping in mind this situation, this paper discusses the limitations of MUD in detail and proposed a framework to identify the patch and default vulnerabilities by using blockchain method before the generation/creation of MUD profiles.

This work aims to explore and analyze the state of the art on assumptions and their management in software development.

Method
A systematic mapping study that covers the literature from January 2001 to December 2015 on assumptions and their management in software development.

Results
134 studies were included: (1) The studies were published in 94 venues, which indicates that assumptions and their management has been a broad topic in software engineering. (2) Only 21 studies defined the assumption concept. (3) Most assumptions are made for or related to the artifacts in requirements engineering and software design, which demonstrates that assumptions should be managed from the early phases of software development. (4) Much effort has been put on Assumptions Making, Description, and Evaluation. Assumptions Maintenance received moderate attention. More than half of the tools identified aim to support assume-guarantee reasoning. For the other tools, most of them can be used to support Assumptions Description. (5) All the identified types of stakeholders are involved in Assumptions Making, followed by Evaluation and Description. Stakeholders involved in requirements engineering, software design, and software construction play a central role in assumptions management. (6) The main challenge is the difficulty of performing assumptions management activities in software development. (7) The identified assumptions management approaches, tools, benefits, and lessons learned are limited to their specific contexts (e.g., context of use).

It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment.

Objective: Empirically verify the use and impact of software security engineering activities in the context of agile software development, as practiced by software developer professionals.

Method: A survey (
) was performed among software practitioners in Finland regarding their use of 40 common security engineering practices and their perceived security impact, in conjunction with the use of 16 agile software development items and activities.

Results: The use of agile items and activities had a measurable effect on the selection of security engineering practices. Perceived impact of the security practices was lower than the rate of use would imply: This was taken to indicate a selection bias, caused by e.g. developers’ awareness of only certain security engineering practices, or by difficulties in applying the security engineering practices into an iterative software development workflow. Security practices deemed to have most impact were proactive and took place in the early phases of software development.

Conclusion: Systematic use of agile practices conformed, and was observed to take place in conjunction with the use of security practices. Security activities were most common in the requirement and implementation phases. In general, the activities taking place early in the life cycle were also considered most impactful. A discrepancy between the level of use and the perceived security impact of many security activities was observed.
